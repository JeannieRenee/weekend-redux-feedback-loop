# FEEDBACK LOOP

## Description

_Duration: 16 hours_

I was asked to create an application that allows a user leave feedback to Prime Digital Academy on how their day went. 

The user will select how they feel and move to the next page. The user's data is stored locally only until they reach the final submit page, so that they have the chance to review and edit if need be. Once submitted, the data is sent to a database for storage. I also created a non-linked endpoint /admin for an admin to access and view all the previously submitted data in a table view.  When creating apps its of utmost importance to me to keep the UI intuitive, and I love when webpages resemble real life items.
